Problem Statement: “ IF A PERSON MEETS WITH AN ACCIDENT AND REQUIRES MEDICAL AID IMMEDIATELY ,WHAT WILL THE INJURED PERSON DO IF HE/SHE CANNOT  CONTACT FOR MEDICAL AID AND THERE IS NO ONE AROUND THEM TO HELP ? ”
Ideation: Whether it is about safety or features, the car manufacturers are always upgrading their cars. They always try to serve best to their consumers. It will be a better approach to merge this safety feature with mobile apps. 
It would be a great and effective collaboration which will help to boost the technology in the field of safety and road accidents.

We have used:
GPS (GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM) technology that uses a network of global satellites to compute the exact location of a device or a person.

MIT APP INVENTOR is an intuitive, visual programming environment that allows everyone even children to build fully functional apps for smartphones and tablets.

Technology used:There are approximately 1214 road accident which happens everyday out of which 75% due to car collision. ACCI TRACK is a life saver app occurs which will basically send immediate information of the met accident with proper  spot and time details to the government bodies like Police ,Hospitals, Fire brigade so that they can immediately take possible measures and save the life of the person.

About Acci Track:BENEFITS TO THE SOCIETY:
1. Time-saving
   Call to action time will be reduced.

2. User friendly 
   The app will be simple and
   convenient to use.

3. Life saviour
   It will help in saving the life of all the person
   
   BRIEF WORKING OF THE APPLICATION:
ACCI TRACK app will connect with the accelerometer which will be able to measure the intensity of the accident. The app will be very easy to access.

When a major accident occurs, a person could send a text or a recording to his/her close one’s or the last contact. The ACCI TRACK app through GPS will share the live location of the car.

Through GPS tracking system, the PARTICULAR INFORMED PERSON CAN send the message to the Police, Hospitals, etc. which will help to minimize the response time and act quickly.
   
Future Scope:
Furthermore, we can also add a feature in our app which will acknowledge everyone that an accident has occurred in the following area.This will contribute towards saving the time of the other people who had to take the same route and they can pass by some other route.Moreover,this will also save the time for the ambulance and the other government bodies reaching  as the routes will be vacant.

In future, this project will help the car companies to enhance their safety features.

An ECU stores the module of airbag deployment .So, through ECU we will connect the phone and get the information.

It will help in monitoring the security of military cars and vehicles during military operations.
